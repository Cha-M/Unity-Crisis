# Unity-Crisis
Randomiser for Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri

Run this from your SMAX folder.  
Alien Crossfire is required currently.  
Aggressiveness is randomised incrementally with Pacifist factions more likely to remain Pacifist or go Erratic than go Aggressive.  
Any faction has a random chance to land in the sea and become Aquatic.  

Work in progress.
